Objective

    For this exercise, we will code a chatbot (albeit one with limited functionality). The chatbot will have the ability to differentiate between general input and yes/no questions, giving appropriate responses accordingly.


Requirements

    Create an HTML interface with the following elements:
        A <textarea> for responses
        An <input> for input
        A <button> for submitting input

    Store sets of words as arrays:
        Greetings
        Punctuation
        Prompts
        Question words
        Question responses
        General responses

    Initially, prompt the user to enter their name

    Use an Event Listener to handle a click event for the button

    As the first response, have the chatbot greet the user using a randomly selected greeting

    Check the first word of subsequent input, and if it matches a question word, have the chatbot respond appropriately:
        If the user asked a yes/no question, give a randomly selected answer from the corresponding array
        If the user entered something else, give a random generic response
